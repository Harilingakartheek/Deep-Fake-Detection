# Deep Fake Detection Using Siamese Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting deep fakes using a 3-phase Siamese neural network model. The main components of the project involve frame extraction from videos, followed by face and patch extraction from the frames, and finally running the prediction on the extracted data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-fake-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd deep-fake-detection
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Frame Extraction

First, you need to extract frames from your input video. This process will create a new folder containing the extracted frames.

1. Run the frame extraction script:

    ```bash
    python frame_extraction.py --input_path path/to/your/video.mp4 --output_path path/to/save/frames
    ```

    Replace `path/to/your/video.mp4` with the path to your input video, and `path/to/save/frames` with the desired output directory for the frames.

### Face and Patch Extraction

After extracting frames, you need to extract faces and patches from these frames. This process will create two new folders: one for faces and one for patches.

1. Run the face and patch extraction script:

    ```bash
    python face_patch_extraction.py --input_path path/to/save/frames --face_output_path path/to/save/faces --patch_output_path path/to/save/patches
    ```

    Replace `path/to/save/frames` with the path to the directory containing the extracted frames, `path/to/save/faces` with the desired output directory for the faces, and `path/to/save/patches` with the desired output directory for the patches.

### Running Prediction

Finally, you need to run the prediction script on the extracted faces and patches to detect deep fakes.

1. Run the prediction script:

    ```bash
    python predict.py --face_path path/to/save/faces --patch_path path/to/save/patches --output_path path/to/save/predictions
    ```

    Replace `path/to/save/faces` with the path to the directory containing the extracted faces, `path/to/save/patches` with the path to the directory containing the extracted patches, and `path/to/save/predictions` with the desired output directory for the prediction results.
